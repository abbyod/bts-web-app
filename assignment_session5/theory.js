//Q1. Could you explain me if Typescript brings any advantage from your point of view?

//Typescript has a compiler, which provides type and error checking when coding. 
//It checks for type validity and shows errors in real time. Itâ€™s useful for refactoring code, 
//because the compiler shows users things they may have missed.

//Q2. One of the differences between Vue and React, is that React uses JSX, after doing some research, 
//could you explain me your opinion about JSX?

//With JSX, you can write code that looks very similar to HTML, but you have the power of
//mixing JavaScript methods and variables into your code.
//Developers can easily embed pieces of JS into templates without having to learn an additional language. 
//Anyone familiar with HTML, CSS, or JS should have no problem reading and understanding JSX
