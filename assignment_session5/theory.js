//Could you explain me if Typescript brings any advantage from your point of view?
//Typescript has a compiler, which provides type and error checking when coding. 
//It checks for type validity and shows errors in real time. Itâ€™s useful for refactoring code, 
//because the compiler shows users things they may have missed.
